# Shell History and Tab Completion

# Shell history is stored in memory and on disk:
~/.bash_history
~/.history
~/.histfile

# History command:
history        Displays the shell history.
HISTSIZE       Controls the number of commands to retain in history.

# Default size is limited to 500 lines. To change that value, do the following:

# Open your personal initialization file, which is usually ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile, in a text editor.
# Add the following line to the file: export HISTSIZE=1000
# Save the file and exit the text editor.
# Reload the shell by running the command source ~/.bashrc or source ~/.profile.

# ! Syntax:
!N        Repeat command line number N.
!!        Repeat the previous command line.
!string   Repeat the most recent command starting with "string".

# Tab completion ---> self-explanatory

# History examples:

echo $HISTSIZE    This will show the current size limit.
