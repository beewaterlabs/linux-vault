# Disk Management

# Partitions      Disk divided into parts = Partition
                  Allow you to separate data

# Partitioning schemes:        
# As a system administrator, you decide. (solo) 
# Make sure you are using the approved standard for your team's environment.

df -h             Provides a summary of available and used disk space for each mounted file system:
-------Fedora 34-------

/dev/vda2                      1014M  254M  761M  26% /boot

# MBR             A boot secotor at the begining of a storage device.
                  The partition table that resides in the MBR contains information on how the logical partitions are orginized on the disk.
                  Can only address 2 TB of disk space currently ---> Being phased out by GPT (GUID Partition Table).     
                  Allows up to 4 partitions (MBR Partitions Scheme)
                  Extended partitions allow you to created an unlimited number of logical partitions.

# GPT             GUID Partition Table (Global Unique Identifier)
                  Is replacing the older MBR partitioning scheme.
                  Part of the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
                  UEFI is replacing BIOS.
                  There are no primary or extended partitions with GPT.
                  GPT supports up to 128 partitions.
                  Supports up to 9.4 ZB disk sizes
                  Not supported by older operating systems.
                  May require newer or special tools.

# Mount points    A directory used to access the data on a partition.

/ (slash)         Is always a mount point.
/home             The 'home' partition mount point.
/home/admin       The admin mount point of the 'home' partition.

# fdisk           Create and modify partitions on a disk.
                  Supports GPT. (Current versions)
                  To manage partitons on a disk with fdisk:    fdisk /path/to/device

# Alternatives:   gdisk, parted
