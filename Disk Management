# MBR        A boot secotor at the begining of a storage device.
             The partition table that resides in the MBR contains information on how the logical partitions are orginized on the disk.
             Can only address 2 TB of disk space currently ---> Being phased out by GPT (GUID Partition Table).     
             Allows up to 4 partitions (MBR Partitions Scheme)
             Extended partitions allow you to created an unlimited number of logical partitions.

# GPT        GUID Partition Table (Global Unique Identifier)
             Is replacing the older MBR partitioning scheme.
             Part of the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
             UEFI is replacing BIOS.
