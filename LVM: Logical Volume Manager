# LVM - Logical Volume Manager:

# Easily Resize Storage While Online:        Expand or shrink file systems in real-time while the data remains online and fully accessible.
                                             Easily migrate data from one storage device to another while online.

# Convenient Device Naming:                  You can use human-readable device names of your choosing.                                      /data 
                                                                                                                                           /\  /\
# Disk Striping:                             Increase throughput by allowing your system to read data in parallel.    ([Storage drive A]   ||  || [Storage drive B])

# Data Redundancy / Data Mirroring:          Increase fault tolerance and reliability by having more than one copy of your data.    ([Storage drive A] <--/data--> [Storage drive B])

# Snapshots:                                 Create point-in-time snapshots of your fillesystems.

                                             Storage Devices

# Logical Volume Creation Process:           Create one or more physical volumes.
                                             Create a volume group from one or more physical volumes.
                                             Create one or more logical volumes from the volume group.

lvmdiskscan                                  LVMDiskScan is a command-line utility used to scan all block devices in the system for Logical Volume Manager (LVM) physical volumes (PVs).

lsblk -p                                    The -p option in the lsblk command is used to display key-value pairs for each device.
df -h                                       The df -h command is used to display disk space usage information for mounted file systems in a human-readable format.
fdisk -l                                    The fdisk -l command lists the partitions on a disk:

                                            Device: The disk device file (e.g., /dev/sda, /dev/nvme0n1p1, etc.).
                                            Start: The starting sector of the partition.
                                            End: The ending sector of the partition.
                                            Size: The size of the partition in sectors, cylinders, or human-readable format (e.g., MB, GB).
                                            Id: The partition type (e.g., 83 for Linux, 0x07 for HPFS/NTFS).
                                            System: The file system type (e.g., Linux, NTFS, FAT32).

pvcreate /dev/sd_                           To create a pyhsical volume.
pvs -o pv_name,pv_size                      Displays only the name and size of each physical volume.

pvs                                         Displays a list of all physical volumes on the system:

vgs                                         Displays information about volume groups, which are collections of physical volumes (PVs) that have been combined into a single logical volume for easier management:

-------Fedora release 34-------

-------Fedora release 34-------

lvcreate [Size] [Name] [Volume Group]       To create a logical volume.
lvcreate -L 20G -n lv_data fedora_fedora    -L (size)
                                            -n (name)

# The Fedora OS that I'm using currently is a virtual machine.
# The volume group was already in place.
# Just adding a logical volume called "lv_data"

-------Fedora release 34-------
[root@fedora adminuser]# lvcreate -L 20G -n lv_data fedora_fedora
  Logical volume "lv_data" created.
-------Fedora release 34-------

lvs                                         View your logical volumes:
