# Firmware

# Make sure system is up-to-date:
sudo yum update && sudo yum upgrade -y 

# For checking the system BIOS or UEFI firmware version:
sudo dmidecode -s bios-version

# Another useful tool is fwupdmgr, which manages firmware updates and displays current firmware versions for supported devices. Install it with:
sudo dnf install fwupd

# In order for changes to fwupd.conf to take effect, you'll need to restart fwupd:
sudo systemctl restart fwupd.service

# Then list devices and their firmware versions:
sudo fwupdmgr get-devices
