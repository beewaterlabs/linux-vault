# Environment Variables:  
## Storage location that has a name and a value.
### Can change how an application behaves.                          
#### Example:
EDITOR=nano

# Viewing Enviroonment variables:
# echo $<ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLE-NAME>

printenv        View environment variables.
printenv HOME   View specific environment variable. 
echo $HOME      Display home HOME environment variable.

# Creating Environment Variables:  (set)
# Syntax:
export VAR="value"

# Examples:
export EDITOR="vi"        Sets the editor to vi.
export TZ="US/Pacific"    Sets the timezone to US Pacific time.

Live example:

# Removing Environment Variables:   (unset)
# Syntax:
unset VAR
# Example:
unset TZ ("TZ" or the Environment Variable name you'd like to unset.)

# The act of setting and unsetting Environment Variables from the cmd line only effects your current running session only.
# Persist Environment Variables:    (Peronal Initialization files - .bashrc <--- configuration file for the Bash shell)
#                                   (.profile <--- configuration file for the userâ€™s shell)
